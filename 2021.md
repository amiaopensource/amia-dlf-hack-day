### Hack Day 2021
Finished Projects:

* [Linked Open Formats](https://github.com/amiaopensource/linked-media-formats): The Linked Open Formats team created an intro to Linked Open Data for AV archivists. It explains why archivists might want to use LOD, parses out examples of LOD in JSON, collects existing LOD resources that focus on AV formats, and even includes a glossary! Team members: Miriam Campos-Quinn, Kathryn Gronsbell, Marlo Longley, Tod Robbins, Joanna White. Winner of “Best Embodiment of the Hackday Ethos” and “Crowd Favorite”!
* [Grabbags](https://github.com/amiaopensource/grabbags): The grabbags team added several new features (including a GUI!) to grabbags, cleaned up existing issues, and implemented robust testing to make it maintainable well into the future. Use grabbags to do bulk bag creation and validation, or to clean up system files from your bags! Team members: Henry Borchers, Jonathan Farbowitz, Bryn Knowles, Milo Thiesen. Winner of “Best Solution to the Problem”!
* [Loglog](https://github.com/amiaopensource/loglog): The loglog team created a set of scripts that provide templates for users who want to add logging to their own code! Team members: Eddy Colloton, Morgan Morel

### What Is Hack Day?
Hack Day is a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access.

Hack Day is a partnership between the Association for Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) and the Digital Library Federation (DLF). A robust and diverse community of practitioners who advance research, teaching and learning through the application of digital library research, technology and services, DLF brings years of experience creating and hosting events designed to foster collaboration and develop shared solutions for common challenges.

It will be fun and practical…and there will be prizes!

Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you are working on during your day job)

The goal of this wiki resource is to:

* consolidate all resources produced by and concerning AMIA/DLF Hack Day;
* document all past hack days and their respective projects;
* provide a template for the organization of future hack days.

Thanks to the past AMIA/DLF Hack Day participants who contributed to the wiki!

### Hack Day 101
#### Summary
The Association of Moving Image Archivists hosts a Hack Day during the annual conference. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical!

AMIA is once again thrilled to partner with the Digital Library Federation in organizing the hack day.

#### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

You have the option to focus on documentation and knowledge sharing. Past projects include Wikipedia Edit-a-thons, creating or updating tool documentation, or reviewing and improving policy, standards, or procedural documentation. So if you're not a developer, or don't feel compelled to lend your digital preservation ideas to software and code development, you can contribute to creating new or updated content for the benefit of our community! You can read all about Wikipedia edit-a-thon events [here.](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon)

#### What will be the format of the event?
In advance of the hack day, project ideas and edit-a-thon topics will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. In advance of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, and Wikipedia editors, selecting an idea or topic(s) to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.

#### Judging & presenting projects
At least one representative from each project group needs to be present for the demonstration of Hack Day projects to jurors. Judging typically lasts for approximately 1.5 -2 hours.

Projects will be presented to attendees in a session, where the jury will announce winners and attendees will vote on their favorite project.
