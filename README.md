## History of these pages

These pages were originally hosted on the CURATEcamp and DLF wikis. As of 2024, the CURATEcamp wiki domain returns no response. All pages were migrated to GitHub and transformed into Markdown as part of Hack Day 2024 by Dave Rodriguez and Annie Schweikert.

* [Original index page index on the DLF Wiki](https://wiki.diglib.org/AMIA-DLF_Hack_Days).
* A full archive of the original wiki lives on the [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20240616044940/https://wiki.diglib.org/AMIA-DLF_Hack_Days).
