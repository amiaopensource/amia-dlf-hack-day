Since 2013, DLF has co-sponsored an annual Hack Day at AMIA conferences, sometimes sending DLF practitioners as funded fellows to participate and sometimes fostering "cross-pollinator" collaborations with our DLF Forum and the National Digital Stewardship Alliance's Digital Preservation conference.

AMIA-DLF Hack Days are unique opportunities for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with digital library developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for audiovisual preservation and access.

## Association of Moving Image Archivists & Digital Library Federation Hack Day
Hack Day is a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. Hack day is a partnership between the Association for Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) and the Digital Library Federation (DLF). A robust and diverse community of practitioners who advance research, teaching and learning through the application of digital library research, technology and services, DLF brings years of experience creating and hosting events designed to foster collaboration and develop shared solutions for common challenges. It will be fun and practical…and there will be prizes!

Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you are working on during your day job)

The goal of this wiki resource is to:
* consolidate all resources produced by and concerning AMIA/DLF Hack Day;
* document all past hack days and their respective projects;
* provide a template for the organization of future hack days.

#### Summary
In association with the annual conference, the Association of Moving Image Archivists will host a Hack Day during the conference. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical.

AMIA is once again thrilled to partner with the [Digital Library Federation](http://www.clir.org/dlf/) in organizing the hack day.

#### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

You have the option to focus on documentation and knowledge sharing. Past projects include Wikipedia Edit-a-thons, creating or updating tool documentation, or reviewing and improving policy, standards, or procedural documentation. So if you're not a developer, or don't feel compelled to lend your digital preservation ideas to software and code development, you can contribute to creating new or updated content for the benefit of our community! You can read all about Wikipedia edit-a-thon events [here](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon).

#### What will be the format of the event?
In advance of the hack day, project ideas and edit-a-thon topics will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. In advance of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, and Wikipedia editors, selecting an idea or topic(s) to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.

#### Judging & presenting projects
At least one representative from each project group needs to be present for the demonstration of Hack Day projects to jurors. Judging typically lasts for approximately 1.5 -2 hours. Snacks and drinks are encouraged.

Projects will be presented to attendees in a session, where the jury will announce winners and attendees will vote on their favorite project.

This year's hack day is a partnership between AMIA and the Digital Library Federation. A robust and diverse community of practitioners who advance research, teaching and learning through the application of digital library research, technology and services, DLF brings years of experience creating and hosting events designed to foster collaboration and develop shared solutions for common challenges.

### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

### Background
#### What is a hack day?
A hack day or hackathon is an event that brings together computer technologists and practitioners for an intense period of problem solving through computer programming. Within digital preservation and curation communities, hack days provide an opportunity for archivists, collection managers, and others to work together with technologists to develop software solutions for digital collections management needs. Hack days have been held independently by groups such as the Open Planets Foundation, as well as in association with preservation and access oriented conferences including Open Repositories and Museums and the Web.

The manifesto of a recent event at the Open Repositories conference framed the benefits this way: “Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams...The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones. Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development...Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier.”

#### Why an AMIA hack day?
An audiovisual preservation-themed CURATEcamp was held in April 2013, drawing over 120 registrants from at least 3 continents for a day of great conversations and lightning talks. CURATEcamp is as series of unconference-style events focused on connecting practitioners and technologists interested in digital curation. The event generated a lot of documentation and articulated many shared concerns. Topics covered included digitization of video, film scanning, digital storage strategies, proprietary digital video files in collections, and technical metadata for preservation. The participants of the event agreed that more work needed to be done and action taken, so the idea for an AMIA hack day was born.

Discussions between managers of audiovisual collections and solutions developers provided a fruitful starting point for a hack day project ideas, including:
* Simple fixity tools to use when transferring files from one storage medium to another
* Technical metadata extraction and making use of these reports (MediaInfo, ffprobe)
* Simple cataloging tools for AV, with eye towards contemporary frameworks/schema
* Discovery tools/UX for audiovisual collections, access at scale

#### Our Manifesto
Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones.
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier.

### Project proposals
[Please register for the hack day](https://docs.google.com/a/bavc.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dENkeXlLY3JCX3pNYldGMEV5ZHRucWc6MA#gid=0) (we're currently at capacity, but forming a wait list) and we will start adding your ideas here for voting in advance of the Hack Day!

Possible topics projects could touch on: fixity checking; transcoding; metadata validation; automating file movement; altering [fdupes](https://code.google.com/p/fdupes/) so that it will show user md5 checksum hash; alter [Archivematica 1.0](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica) code to bypass zipping the AIP.

Loose metadata projects ideas: Segmentation and time-based annotation of video segments on the web (maybe leveraging [Media Fragments?](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/http://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/)); XSLT mapping; Turn CSV fields into PREMIS xml; Using geolocation information to facilitate new access pathways to video; RDFing PBCore, potentially to leverage in Fedora 4

Loose non-code projects ideas: Editing/adding wikipedia pages, create a manual for a tool or a workflow, create a webpage

Please submit your project ideas using the format below. Remember, the more specific the better. Have a look at the project descriptions from [Open Repositories 2013](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/http://or2013.net/content/developers-challenge-ideas-list) for inspiration.

### Project Sign Up Sheet
Sign up for projects you are interested in [here](https://docs.google.com/a/avpreserve.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsusZsPewvsxdFpnZXk2Rkg1dXh0ZUhJRjg2OEwwbmc&usp=sharing#gid=0)

Signing up in advance does not mean you are committed to work on that project. And it does not mean these are the only projects. There will still be an opportunity to add additional projects on the day of the event and sign up for those as well.

The projects below were discussed during a Google Hangout on November 1, 2013. For more information, please see the [notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/https://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2013/PlanningHangout_1101) from that conversation.

### 1. The 608ers: [Timebased transcript/caption display](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2013/EIA-608_TT)

Two proposals have merged into one:

Extraction of EIA-608/line 21 closed caption information: Ability to extract and reuse closed caption information from NTSC video.

+

Interactive Video/Transcript Streaming: This project would use the open source Interactive Video/Transcript viewer package as a baseline for streaming video and transcripts. This package has weak support and is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. The hope is to come up with an approach to build or improve upon the existing system to reliably stream video files with their time coded transcripts across multiple browser and OS types.

Original input is mp4 interviews spoken in Inuktitut with their English transcripts in doc format. The video and transcript need to be streamed/played simultaneously.

### 2. Team McGruff: Integration of mediainfo generated metadata into a forensic imaging workflow
Would like to generate and include mediainfo key/value pairs into DFXML for forensic disk images that contain audio or video files. This could be accomplished through the FIWalk utility's DGI interface.

Use case: An archive has acquired hard drives containing mixed file formats, including media formats. In order to prevent any further modifications of the drives they have been forensically imaged. To plan for the work necessary to preserve, process and provide access to the media files in the future, the repository would like the ability generate a report on the types and extents of media files within disk images.

+

Reconciling filenames with embedded technical metadata/named parameters: I'd like to explore if it would be possible to compare embedded technical metadata (file/MIME type/external signature) to existing media filenames to ensure that all files in a given directory are what they are supposed to be according to the extension. There can be messages/a report if any files do not match your named parameters.

Potential User Story: As a CONTENT MANAGER, I need to verify that files with an "mov" extension in a named directory (*.mov) are Quicktime files so that I can ensure filenames accurately represent embedded technical metadata.

Pre-conditions: Specifications of files already determined (ie all access files are qt wrapped .mov), Have associated utilities available to read metadata

Post conditions: Filenames include accurate extension, content manager is delivered a report of any/all inaccurately named files in directory.

#### HowToRunThe Media Walker

https://github.com/dmmd/AMIA_HACK/blob/master/fiwalk/mediainfo.py

https://github.com/dmmd/AMIA_HACK/blob/master/fiwalk/ficonfig.txt

Ensure that the following are installed on your computer:
xcode: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
homebrew: http://brew.sh/
mediainfo: On the command line enter $ brew install mediainfo
sleuthkit: On the command line enter $ brew install sleuthkit
python: On the command line enter $ brew install python

I don't have Python installed on my computer!!! Don't freak. PIP is a Python package installer. You need it to install LXML, which is a popular parser for Python. Here's the command line:

$ sudo easy_install pip

Then, type the command, below (it takes awhile). Lxml is the most popular xml parser, by the way:

$ sudo pip install lxml

While you're waiting, you need to customize the config file!

Open "ficonfig.txt" in a text editor. Then, update the location of the script on your local drive. It initially looks like: * dgi python fiwalk/mediainfo.py and you insert your filepath before the fiwalk.mediainfo.py portion...thus, becoming (as an eg.) * dgi python /Users/yvonne/Desktop/amia_hack/fiwalk/mediainfo.py. Whew! Save your doc, and close.


Pre-config of .txt

Post-config sample of .txt

Then, you want to run Mediawalker in fiwalk. This command will create your DFXML file with audio/video metadata! Make sure that you redirect the standard output with a ">" to a filename ending in ".xml"

$ fiwalk -xc /FILEPATH/TO/ficonfig.txt /FILEPATH/TO/yourDiskImage > /PREFERRED/DESTINATION/FOR/THE/DFXML.xml

### 3. Metadata Schemers: Metadata schema developing and mapping tool
#### Original project proposal
Metadata is becoming more and more important for various aspects of video archiving (i.e. conservation, management, access etc.), but there is little help for non-AV specialist practicioners. An easy-to-use tool with a simple graphical interface could be one valuable element. The project could be to develop a tool for editing existing (or self-developed) metadata schemas/standards with export functionalities producing schemas in useful formats (like XML, stylesheets, etc.) useable in widespread programmes used for collection management/description (like FileMaker, Excel, Access, etc.). An additional part of such a tool could be a mapping and data transformation element, allowing users to map one existing schema (in different file formats like XML, CSV) to a target schema (like EBUCore) and transform existing data. An online version of such a tool could collect and disseminate edited schemas, crosswalks, mapping schemas, etc. and serve as exchange platform.

#### Possible starting points
* MINT is an online tool used in several AV-heritage projects that is open source. Source code not available, but info here: http://mint.image.ece.ntua.gr/redmine/projects/mint/wiki/Introduction

* any interest in creating mappings to allow [dp.la/info/about/faq/ DPLA] to expose richer metadata about sound/moving image content? {DPLA crosswalks here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApDps8nOS9g5dHp5ZE10YS10amljdXRVS3dqYXRvTXc#gid=0) or more info as needed...

Your Path to a Shiny New Schema!
Problem
Many schemas and frameworks exist for AV metadata, which rarely fully meet the needs of any given organization or collection; the use of standards is not widespread in AV conservation, leading to problems for sharing and aggregating on access platforms. Additionally, data is often supplied in forms that are not suitable for direct upload into the collection management system/database, requiring time and IT skills to manually correct prior to ingest.

Project Scope

This application will be developed iteratively. Right now, it will create a custom metadata schema derived from an uploaded data set and existing metadata schemas.

In its first phase, this application will not perform data mapping and transformation; these functions might be available in a later phase. (See Further Work.) It will be a web-based application using Javascript. In its first iteration, it will only be able to import files in XML or CSV formats, and will only export schemas in XML and CSV formats.

Intended User Base

Librarians, archivists, and other professionals with limited knowledge of AV metadata standards, who nevertheless may be tasked with the creation, management, or transformation of moving image metadata, and are also limited in proficiency with programming or do not have advanced IT knowledge. This application is very source-agnostic and it can be used to create custom schemas from any metadata standards.

Benefits

• Provides a generic interface to develop a custom metadata schema based on existing data sets (extracting elements) and (standard) schemas.

• Provides a generic interface to map disparate data sources to various metadata schemas.

• Is scalable to different projects and different types of metadata.

• Creates efficiencies as staff time previously used to manually manage metadata can be used for other tasks.

• Allows for ease of metadata standardization across databases and systems.

High Level Functional Requirements

• Ability to import metadata schemas for AV materials

• Ability to extract fields from an uploaded data set as data elements

• Ability to rearrange, split, merge, rename, compare and map data elements from imported schemas and data set, to create a custom metadata model

• Ability to export custom metadata model as XML and CSV

• Ability to keep track of what is being mapped and the sources of the constituent data elements

User Stories

• As a metadata manager, I work with multiple streams of non-standardized data that need to be collated and made to conform to my organization’s data model. I would like a system where I can integrate the multiple streams of metadata, map them to my model, and create a custom schema that correctly describes the asset to an accepted standard according to that model.

• As a metadata manager, I work with legacy systems that do not all use the same metadata schema. I would like a system that will allow me to easily map the data in those legacy systems to a single standard.

• As a metadata analyst, I have user generated metadata coming in from various projects. I work with books that are digitized, e-books, postcard digitization and digital video projects. I want a system where I can map user generated metadata to various fields from other metadata standards.

• As an archivist, I have to develop a metadata schema suitable for AV media, which can be integrated with existing tools (finding aids etc.).

• As an archivist, I receive information from content generators that does not conform to a format that I can use. It seems unlikely that they can be initially "trained" to provide data in a more standardised format. I would like a tool that will allow me to make my work more efficient while more easily providing feedback to data suppliers on how this data might be improved for my use.

Further Work

Suggestions for future development

• Creation of data entry form based on custom schema and rules determined in data mapping step so that content providers can conform to proper data formatting

• Ability to save custom models previously created as templates

• Ability to collect and disseminate edited schemas, crosswalks, mapping schemas, etc. and serve as a sharing platform

• Create RDF functionality from generated metadata schemas.

• Explore data mapping and transformation functionality: the ability to import sets of data and perform mapping and transformation to conform to the custom metadata model/schema; user-friendly interface to create rules for simple data transformation, e.g. standardise date format, provide default value for fields with no data, etc.

### 4. The Amazing METS: Creating a Sample METS (Addressing METS Specification) for Digitization Project of Analog Audiovisual Collections
Several sets of specifications are already available for creating a METS schema. But I have not really heard of any complete METS example that is boilerplated to work for a real digitization project. University of Michigan, after several trials to look for existing schema that we can piggyback, is currently creating an example METS for outsourced digitization project that can be used from end to end. The application programmer at Digital Library Production Service department has created it out of the existing audio METS xml, VideoMD, and other spreadsheets that U of M has been using as interim means. And several related people are now discussing and examining that sample section by section. I would like to know if a group can sit and investigate this current sample and give comments/feedback about its possible limitations/errors/issues to make a better version out of it. If the whole sample is too big to work on in a day, I would like to propose to review the process history/provenance section only since that could be the most challenging section to tackle due to complicated video digitization process itself. If we can come up with anything that seems to work as a working sample, it can be shared/distributed and used at this standard-less age.

And here again, an online version of such a tool could collect and disseminate edited schemas, crosswalks, mapping schemas etc. and serve as exchange platform.

[Day of notes](https://docs.google.com/a/avpreserve.com/document/d/1iO1pbIZK9a3QFkLBdDOZBskzNHjhqfuJE2f2r6pAvx4/edit)

#### Possible starting points
Here are very drafty draft that UM programmer created. There are many notes and it does not quite look complete but I believe this can be a starting point. More than anything, we are in need of any outsiders who can review this with fresh eyes and many other different experiences.

Both the video process history schema and example METS are located in the directory: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~grosscol/vprocesshistory/

* reVTMD possibly useful to incorporate?
* interest in PREMIS event entity w. this info?

#### Related skillsets
Knowledge of video/audio metadata, familiarity with audiovisual digitization project?

#### Data set required
Existing metadata set that are created from the digitization project at each institution

#### Solution
Use Case: Our use case for project is a single content item, on analog video tape, which is reformatted to a digital file set. The source object, digitization process, and resulting file set should be described in one METS file.

Solution: Our objective for the purposes of the hack day is to articulate a content model within METS for reformatted video content. Our goals include:

* Identify existing schemas that can be used to express the various components of the METS file
* Determine how those schemas should be expressed within METS containers
* Identify minimal fields that should be captured using those schemas within METS
* Articulate controlled vocabularies when applicable

#### Deliverables:

* Create a sample METS file for a U-matic source object, which is reformatted and results in a preservation master and mezzanine file, document the sample describing element usage, and enumerating recommended controlled vocabularies where appropriate
* Refine the model with input from the community with the goal of eventually creating a METS profile which can be added to the profile registry maintained by the standards office at the Library of Congress.

The project is maintained in a [github](https://github.com/amiaopensource/amazingmets) repository. Documentation and notes are available [here](https://docs.google.com/a/avpreserve.com/document/d/1iO1pbIZK9a3QFkLBdDOZBskzNHjhqfuJE2f2r6pAvx4/edit).

### 5. Fast Forward: Produce easy-to-follow documentation for the installation and use of FFMPEG transcoding software
Specific usage topics might include batch transcoding, metadata extraction, common output profiles, and FFMPEG version upgrades. Evaluation of available GUI's might also be included as a secondary goal.

### Merged with Timecoded transcripts and FFMPEG documentation: Moving Image Research Collections Digital Video Repository
Several potential ideas for improving this DVR that can hopefully be integrated into other sites…
- Timecode-based tagging in videos or other ways to allow for user-generated metadata
- A way to connect related video material
- scripts for transcoding video (modifying an existing script)
- Issues in XACML restrictions / easy way to make records public/non-public

### Replaced by Format/Codec selection tool: Digitization workflow development tool


Where do I start once I decided digitization is the right thing to do for my video collection? How do I decide whether to built up infrastructure/know how in-house or to outsource digitization? How do I need to prepare analog tapes for best results and minimal risk? What information do I need and which requirements do I have to ask for in a call for tenders? What do I have to do and how to controll the quality of digitization? How do I store the new archive masters and access copies? Which codecs/formats are best in my case? A little stand-alone or online tool for video collections/non-specialist practicioners, maybe something like an interactive flow-chart or decision path, that helps to ask the right questions and produces an automatic report after running it could be a big help for lots of non-video-specialist collection managers and serve as starting point for consultations, evaluation of tenders, convincing of decision makers etc. A possible online version of a tool like this could integrate a "similar projects"-functionality, pointing collection managers to other projects/people with experience in similar cases and thereby built up/strenghten a network for exchange. I think there is still a big potential in bringing people of this field together!

#### Possible starting points
There are tons of online survey tools that maybe could be used as technical starting point; the right set of questions could be collected/priorized/structured during the hack day.

#### Related skillsets
Unknown technical/developer's skills and some video digitization and collection management expertise is needed for this project.

#### Data set required
None.

==4. Format/codec evaluation/selection tool== "What format should I use when digitizing my videos?" This is by far the most heard question for video archiving consultants, I guess. But possible answers are complicated and very context-related, say: often frustrating for the asking non-specialist practicioners as for consultants. For a possible hack day project see description of submitted idea for a digitization workflow development tool above. A format/codec evaluation/selection tool could be part of or a first element of this bigger tool.

==8. CURATEcamp-syle discussion==

For those that are more interested in meeting up with other folks for discussion and brainstorming on specific topics, we are setting aside an area for a CURATEcamp style "unconference" breakout groups. Folks interested should come prepared with potential topics for discussion. These will be gathered on the morning of the event, and voted on by those registrants in the CURATEcamp stream. For more information, please visit the [CURATEcamp website](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/http://curatecamp.org/), and see the documentation from [CURATEcamp AVpres 2013](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520122506/https://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/CURATEcamp_AVpres_2013) held in April 2013.

Please note that while discussion groups are not discouraged, these groups will not be eligible for awards.

### Depreciated topics

### Summary
In association with the annual conference, the Association of Moving Image Archivists will host its 2nd annual hack day on October 8, 2014 in Savannah, GA. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. This year, we will be holding a concurrent Wikipedia Edit-a-thon[1] for those interested in adding to knowledge pool about audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical.

AMIA is again partnering with the Digital Library Federation in organizing the hack day. A robust and diverse community of practitioners who advance research, teaching and learning through the application of digital library research, technology and services, DLF brings years of experience creating and hosting events designed to foster collaboration and develop shared solutions for common challenges.

### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

The day will also include a Wikipedia Edit-a-thon. So even if you're not a developer, nor feel compelled to lend your digital preservation ideas to software and code development, you can contribute to creating new or updated content on Wikipedia for the benefit of our community! You can read all about Wikipedia edit-a-thon events [here](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon).

### Background
#### What is a hack day?

A hack day or hackathon is an event that brings together computer technologists and practitioners for an intense period of problem solving through computer programming. Within digital preservation and curation communities, hack days provide an opportunity for archivists, collection managers, and others to work together with technologists to develop software solutions for digital collections management needs. Hack days have been held independently by groups such as the Open Planets Foundation, as well as in association with preservation and access oriented conferences including Open Repositories and Museums and the Web.

The manifesto of a recent event at the Open Repositories conference framed the benefits this way: “Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams...The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones. Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development...Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier.”

#### Our Manifesto
Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you a working on during your day job)

### Hack Day Projects
Below are loose ideas for projects to hack on! If you're interested in one of the project stubs below, sign up for a wiki login and add your thoughtful comments or possible starting points to the proposal, or contact the proposer via twitter or email. As the Hack Day approaches, we'll brainstorm further and consolidate like-minded projects.

#### Hack day capture: GUI tool for BMDCapture, using FFmpeg + BMDTools + BlackMagic Decklink SDK
Proposed by Dave Rice, @dericed
Lauren Sorensen - @laurensx
Dave Rice - @dericed
Tommy from Video Film Solutions
Shai Drori, Independent

Adding a GUI with XCode and adding some features to vrecord, an open source tool that can be used with Blackmagic hardware. Making it so it is controlled by the GUI (Mac), outputting to MOV container with various options for codec: uncompressed, FFV1, motion JPEG-2000, Prores. https://github.com/amiaopensource/hackdaycapture https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q6qEk3gHKNzf6jtEIzzl2-vKwjgUzOTXr6TmUej2mgc/edit

#### New and Improved PBCore Tools
This team is creating two PBCore 2.0 tools which can easily be updated when the next PBCore schema version is released. The tools include an updated PBCore XML record validator and PBCore XML record generator.

##### PBCore Validator

Updated and replaced application components to create an improved version based on the PBCore 2.0 XML. We are also including a Dublin Core validator through the same web application.

    View it: http://infinite-spire-2035.herokuapp.com
    Github Repo: https://github.com/tessafallon/pbcorevalidator/

##### PBCore Record Generator

We built a basic Rails webform and extracted the PBCore export code from the WGBH project HydraDAM developed by WGBH and DCE so that we have a lightweight web application to enter metadata based on the PBCore data model and export in well-formed PBCore 2.0 XML. We are also planning to provide a Dublin Core export via this form.

#### Video Characterization Comparison Viewer
The tool runs multiple command line video characterization applications (ffprobe, mediainfo, exiftool) on a given AV file/set of files and outputs the results in a format that is easy for comparative analysis. The aim of the tool is to identify differences in the outputs of these common applications, with the goal of better understanding the tools, and possibly submitting reports to their developers and eventually improving them.

##### Use cases for the tool

* Compare different tool outputs in order to determine what tool to use in your characterization workflows
* Reporting on differences in order to understand how the tool calculates the outputs
* Identifying bugs in order to report to the tool developers

This project build on a similar project that was developed during the Open Repositories 2014 Developer Challenge (although the #AVHack14 version is bigger and better). Read more about that [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20240714164222/http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?p=966).

#### Video Sprites!
Video thumbnail summaries as metadata. Created a command line program (wrapped as a Ruby gem) that exports thumbnail images, a thumbnail sprite image, and WebVTT metadata. A user can run a bash command and specify an input video or folder of video and Video Sprites will utilize ffmpeg and ImageMagick to export these files.

Each command can be specified with the following flags.

* -f for frames. Optional. Time between the snapshots. (Default 5 seconds.)
* -w for width. Optional. Width of the each thumbnail. (Default 200.)
* -c for columns. Number of columns in the sprite. (Default 5.)
* -k for keep. Keep all the individual images and other intermediate artifacts.
* -i for input. This is the only required field. (Default: Current working directory.)
* -o for output. Output directory. (Default: Current working directory with "output" directory.)
* -v for verbose. Detailed comments when processing.
* -z for clean. Optional. Clear the output directory for files named like the input file before execution. (Defaults to false)
* -h for help. Explains each flag.

- Charlotte Johnson / Jessica Storm Currently we are scanning a lot of audio reels, doing minimal clean up and ingesting into our DAM system. The files are delivered by title, in folders with 5-15 .wav files on average.

We're in need of a script, or tool that can help us validate audio .wav files, as well as help us expedite prepping the material for ingest. Right now, all we can do is run an MD5 and compare that with what the vendor sent us. We'd like to take it a step further, but opening and checking every file individually is out of the question.

Ideally the script/tool would:

-Be executionable at a folder level -Be able to exclude certain file types (i.e., MD5, ptx, pdf..) -Make sure each file is playable -Look for drop outs and/or pops in each wav -Get the sample rate / kHz & bit rate of each wav -Output a "QC" report with results and metadata -create MD5s for each wav (and possibly compare that MD5s with provided MD5)


Any help we can get quickly validating that the content is "good" would be helpful. The tools we've experimented using, and scripts we've tried, just aren't doing what we need.

#### Scripts for using wget that retain organizational metadata

-@DaleLore Developing a script that uses the wget command line to archive webpages and includes important metadata for organization.

#### DPX header metadata

Our project is about better editing/writing of DPX header metadata. We would like to focus on:

* enabling more complete metadata editing of all header fields in the DPX standard. Commercially available tools like Pomfort DPX Header Editor do not have this ability.
* batch editing of these header fields
* enable embedding of individual file checksum values into a/some header fields of those individual DPX files

We think this would be a great project for any archive working (or planning on working) with DPX files. Hopefully the project could be the beginnings of a tool such as BWF MetaEdit

#### Exporting OpenRefine clusters & TIDY: Tool for Improving Data Yourself

[OpenRefine with TIDY add-on (Mac release)](https://github.com/amiaopensource/OpenRefine) available here
[TIDY beta visualisation here](https://github.com/amiaopensource/OpenRefine)


GROUP: Data Detox (the makers of TIDY) Kathryn Gronsbell | Cora Johnson-Roberson | Michelle Roell | Caleb Sayan

OBJECTIVE: Export OpenRefine clusters for review and normalisation opportunities

OVERVIEW: Add export cluster feature to OpenRefine to work with suggested data outside of the system. Create graphic representation of suggested cluster reconciling opportunities using the foundational JSON export. Harnesses the power of the OpenRefine algorithms for whatever you need! This would allow you to review the recommended clusters and be better informed / make decisions when choosing between terms from a messy data set. The output allows you to manipulate the data however you want or need, so that you can move through all "similar" data according to OpenRefine's super powerful algorithms. We:

-Added “Export Clusters” to Cluster & Edit screen in OpenRefine project. This feature exports suggested cluster information (JavaScript objects) as JSON includes:

* Project Name
* Column Name
* Timestamp
* Method
* Keying function
* JavaScript objects (clusters)

as output filename formatted: clusters_[projectname]_[columnname]_[timedate].json

#### Non-verbal search engine
Using icons from the Noun project website to create a non verbal icon based search engine. - @textilehive
#### File name generator

I see pretty awful file names for projects and there must be a way to build a small tool to help suggest a consistent, clear naming convention project by project. - Michelle Roell

#### MiniDV integration into last year's hackday project, vrecord
Being able to extend vrecord's capabilities beyond BlackMagic by adding support for firewire-based media connections would help on-the-fly Mac-based migration stations. A caveat to this being a functional project is that we'd need a working MiniDV deck and I'm not willing to tote one across the country with me. But I love you. Kinda. — @ablwr

#### Re-equalizing WAVs
I was recently given a Windows application that re-equalizes wav files that were transferred from their original magnetic audio carriers at the wrong speed (sometimes necessary). It's 32-bit only, though, so I can't use it. Came with the original Forth source code, so my project idea would be to either make a 64-bit version (which I could probly learn on my own) or port it to something more, uh, widely used so that maybe it could find a wider audience. Originally developed by Jay McKnight, formerly of Ampex, now Magnetic Reference Labs. — @CoatesBrendan

#### PBCore/SIP Comparison
A PBCore/SIP comparison. Basically using a PBCore XML record to build a manifest of files and compare the technical data of the metadata record with the actual files. This could use MediaInfo on files mentioned listed in the XML. ﻿ - Henry Borchers

#### Updated PBCore Validator
Continue the work on last year's [PBcore Tools project](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520131620/http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2014#New_and_Improved_PBCore_Tools), incorporating PBCore 2.1 and improving documentation and usability

#### ffmprovsr
Team Name: ffmprovsr / ffmpegged

Project Objective: To facilitate better understanding of ffmpeg through collaborative sharing of useful scripts and detailed flag-level description of how each script works so archivists can copy-paste and produce their own scripts but also understand how and why they work.

Project Proposal:

OK OK OK, just putting out some feelers here. I worked on ffmpeg documentation [2](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmpeg/wiki) during the first hack day and last year I hastily built an app that exists as a guide/command line generator for ffmpeg [3](http://ablwr.github.io/ffmprovisr/) and I think it'd be fun to combine and continue to build up these two projects into something better because ffmpeg continues to live on as a mysterious but necessary component of a/v archival practice. This project would be mostly R&D with some basic front-end web development skills (building forms). I feel this is a little out of the scope of hack day (and those greedy for rewards may seek refuge elsewhere) in that it's more of a REMIX project and a mostly-hack-the-docs-with-some-coding project, but if there is interest (there was last year, for ffmprovisr) -- we will build the hell outta this! -- @ablwr

#### HACK THE DOCS: OAIS Edit-a-thon
— @shirapeltzman

Team Name: OIA-YES

Project Objective: To review and evaluate (from an AV perspective) the OAIS Reference Model with the aim to contribute to the DPC-hosted wiki evaluating it. We identify areas of the standard that could be improved upon, clarified, or expanded to better encompass moving images and other complex digital objects.


Project Proposal: I'd like to propose an OAIS review/revise-a-thon for Hack Day, wherein a group of us could contribute to the OAIS Community Forum Wiki hosted by the DPC.

Paul Wheatley has been updating the active topics for discussion page, and this is a great place for any participants to get involved, and respond to some of the latest proposals and points for discussion. They can of course also start new topics and add them here:

http://wiki.dpconline.org/index.php?title=Active_Topics_and_News

Since its approval in 2002 as an ISO standard (14721), the OAIS reference model has become a--if not the--foundational text for the majority of digital preservation research and resource development. Since then the digital preservation community has grown significantly, sparking an expanded understanding of what precisely constitutes "digital preservation". The Digital Preservation Coalition has responded to these shifts by issuing an open to call to "review and reform" the OAIS standard in advance of its upcoming ISO review in 2017. The opportunity to contribute to this process presents us with a unique opportunity to ensure our voices/concerns heard as moving image archivists and make an impact on OAIS' next iteration.

### How do I sign up/participate?
Sign up! As this will be a highly participatory event, registration is limited to those willing to get their hands dirty, so no onlookers please.

REMOTE PARTICIPATION will be available this year! Check in using the IRC channel and stay tuned to sign up for a project. You can then work offline/independently with your group in whatever way is easiest (video chat, chat, etc).

If you are unsure whether you can or want to participate in the hack day itself, you can still see the results by attending the AMIA closing plenary, where hack day projects will be presented, and the audience will have an opportunity to vote on their favorites.

### What will be the format of the event?
In advance of the hack day, project ideas and edit-a-thon topics will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. In advance of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, and Wikipedia editors, selecting an idea or topic(s) to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.

The day itself will be structured something like this. Coffee/tea will be provided. Lunch is on your own.

9am – Welcome, introductions

9:30 - noon - Hacking & doc editing. Coffee and minimal snacks.

Noon-1pm – Lunch on your own.

1 - 4:30 - Hacking & doc editing. Coffee and minimal snacks.

4:30 - 5 - Wrap up.

### Judging & presenting projects
At least one representative from each project group needs to be present for the demonstration of Hack Day projects to jurors on TIME & DATE TK. Judging typically lasts for approximately 1.5 -2 hours. Snacks and drinks are encouraged.

Projects will be presented to attendees in a session on TIME & DATE TK, where the jury will announce winners and attendees will vote on their favorite project.

### Summary
In association with the annual conference, the Association of Moving Image Archivists will host its 4th annual hack day on November 9h in Portland, OR. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. This year, we will be holding a concurrent Wikipedia Edit-a-thon [1](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon_How-To) for those interested in adding to knowledge pool about audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical.

AMIA is once again thrilled to partner with the Digital Library Federation in organizing the hack day.

### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

### Background
#### What is a hack day?
A hack day or hackathon is an event that brings together computer technologists and practitioners for an intense period of problem solving through computer programming. Within digital preservation and curation communities, hack days provide an opportunity for archivists, collection managers, and others to work together with technologists to develop software solutions for digital collections management needs. Hack days have been held independently by groups such as the Open Planets Foundation, as well as in association with preservation and access oriented conferences including Open Repositories and Museums and the Web.

The manifesto of a recent event at the Open Repositories conference framed the benefits this way: “Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams...The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones. Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development...Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier.”

#### Our Manifesto
Manifesto:

* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you are working on during your day job)

### Hack Day Projects
Please update this list with your name and summary of a project idea / problem you'd like to solve. Below are loose ideas for projects so far. If you have a new project idea, or are interested in one of the project stubs below, sign up for a wiki login and add your thoughtful comments or possible starting points to the proposal, or contact the proposer via twitter.

#### DOCUMENTATION: WikiData for Digital Preservation
🏆 2016 WINNER of BEST FULFILLMENT OF HACK DAY MANIFESTO!

Join the effort to make WikiData useful for Digital Preservation by using Wikidata to describe software, file formats, virtual and emulated environments for computing, and hardware that is virtualized or emulated in those environments.

[Project: Data Curation](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:YULdigitalpreservation/Data_curation) [File Formats](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Informatics/File_formats)

Inspiration: Wikidata as a digital preservation knowledgebase

Here is a link to the WikiProject about file formats: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Informatics/File_formats

PRONOM to wikidata property mapping: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Informatics/File_formats/PRONOM

This query [2](http://tinyurl.com/z7tmmy8) gives us 905 file types and we could just filter out those with audio* video* as part of their mime type

Results

Google doc with more working notes & links [3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nmsp_O5KqcFXywvUV2M8kFFixN7oeNgAXWZMDoOnPhc/edit)

We decided that the right place to start would be to compare the data points on the best known/used format registries (namely PRONOM and LoCFDD) and crosswalk them between each other and the existing format descriptions in WikiData. Our efforts are being added to the WikiData File Formats project pages but are also captured in this Google Doc: [4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cJL58t3-w7gWsUgJ1_KJ-LDUaoxA62s3WbhkE-3e-4/edit#gid=0)

There is a process in place for suggesting new properties in WikiData, so what we have done is made recommendations that the larger project group can consider. For example, some existing properties map well to data kept in PRONOM or LoCFDD, while others could be added. Some we felt are out of scope for the resource like WikiData.

#### DOCUMENTATION: Loggr | Artifact Logging Environmental Scan/Recommendations
-- [Kathryn Gronsbell](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520120158/http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/User:Kgronsbell) (h/t to Kelly Haydon for idea), combined with Charles Hosale's AVAA Idea | Standards, literature, and resource review (and recommendations?) for A/V artifact logging language and format. Documentation variations are extreme between organizations, vendors, and even QA/QC workflows within organizations. Possibility to add to the [AV Artifact Atlas](http://avaa.bavc.org/)

* Team Loggr includes: Kathryn Gronsbell, Charles Hosale, Savannah Campbell, Ethan Gates, Kristin MacDonough, Erica Titkemeyer, Ben Turkus. Special thanks to Kelly Haydon, Lisa Barrier.

* Team Loggr is surveying anonymized audiovisual artifact logging samples from vendors and collecting organizations that represent how vastly inconsistent error and artifact metadata can be. We will create a template for logging artifacts that outputs simple, clear delimited data which sources vocabularies from community resources like the AV Artifact Atlas. This data could be used to prioritize QC procedures.

Problem: Inconsistent practices for logging artifacts in audiovisual material. Unable to parse (and therefore report) on errors and artifacts across collections. We gathered [sample QC and transfer records](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gx-AUbmCuhn80IFBd54coOtwIRJKe5U1hWBosPmYSH8/edit?usp=sharing) and separated artifact, frequency, severity, and duration language to create a prototype.

Prototype: [Basic schema and template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ym4m7u6HYiXob-ozhbSajfIcPvYDOQ--myKC8VIFAs/edit?usp=sharing) for creating delimited, parseable records (e.g. in CSV) that represent the basic profile of an audiovisual artifact. This includes:

* Artifact type (name)
* Artifact severity (how much the issue impacts the clarity of the signal)
* Artifact frequency (how often the issue occurs in a given file)

The simplified Loggr template recommendation aims to:
* use authoritative vocabularies to describe artifact characteristics (e.g. AV Artifact Atlas)
* increase clarity of communication between metadata source and reviewer
* streamline delimited information into parseable fields

Expected outcome: By adopting the 3-element model, organizations could use the resulting information to prioritize quality control and assurance procedures. For example, a file with the same artifact type (“Ghosting”) could have a different priority rating depending on the severity and frequency of the artifact.

DRAFT ARTIFACT SCHEMA

Artifact
* Type <controlled list>
* Severity <numeric scale>
* Frequency <controlled list>


Possible future steps
1. Expand Loggr vocabulary on AV Artifact Atlas (create dynamic feed?) 2. Create simplified submission process for AV Artifact Atlas 3. Aid easy identification of video artifacts by streamlining/bolstering the AV Artifact Atlas according to identified needs:

* Choose hosting/repository for submitted sample files
* Identify place where tasks can be assigned or logged
* Identify best mechanism to review and discuss sample files
* Enable faceted search of non-jargon keywords to create alternate access point for general audiences

#### Linked Film Description Framework
Participants:
* Edward Anderson @anderson_edw
* David Newbury @workergnome
* Kara Van Malssen @kvanmalssen

Description: A linked open data driven web resource for facilitating retrieval of descriptive content about film titles from a variety of web resources. Descriptions include synopses, reviews, and marketing materials. This site is intended to support user stories such as: "As a content provider, I would like to find a context appropriate description of a film based on my user's need and platform."

Features include:
* Autocomplete search on film titles
* Return tombstone metadata for each film including title, director, year of release, country of origin
* Using resources about a given film listed in WikiData, extract and display relevant descriptions in real time
* Display the type (e.g. Synopsis, Review) and source (e.g. IMDB) for each description
* Display descriptions in multiple languages
* Dynamically generate a linked data graph of results, using schema.org and other standard vocabularies

This demo instance is using a test dataset from the British Film Institute.

In the future, additional functionality can be built into the tool to display descriptions appropriate to specific platforms and devices (e.g. short description for Apple TV).

####Checksumthing: A Checksum Crosswalk Python Script #checksumthing
🏆 2016 WINNER of BEST SOLUTION TO THE STATED PROBLEM!

--Proposed by Morgan Morel | Ultimate checksum script! A crosswalk for different kinds of checksum sidecar files. Github repo for the project is at [checksumthing](https://github.com/amiaopensource/checksumthing)

Project Summary

Different pieces of software used to produce checksums create sidecar files (typically files ending in .md5 or .sha1) with very different formatting, which creates headaches for archivists—we love standards and loathe disorder. Checksumthing is a python script that can solve this problem by allowing users transform the data inside sidecar files into a standardized format most convenient for them. For example, you can

* Append text before or after the checksum value (like the path to the file or the filename)
* Change the checksum text to all caps or all lowercase
* Search for checksum files and transform files through a nested directory structure

Ceecksumthing currently supports MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 checksums. Right now the program only supports plaintext sidecar files. In the future, we hope to support CSV and other types of files.

#### RGB integration for FFV1
--Reto Kromer | Integration of tools for the new RGB 16-bit capabilities of FFV1.

#### Improve vrecord interface (COMPLETED)
--Savannah Campbell | Add audio level monitors to vrecord interface. Since the initial proposal time, audio level monitors have been added to [vrecord](https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord).

#### Audio calibration tools
--Andrew Weaver | Work on digital tools for live audio signal analysis to aid with machine calibration and qc. (Possibly an ffplay style interface of filters such as spectrum, lissajous etc).

#### DOCUMENTATION: Improve Cable Bible
-- Ethan Gates | Add power and/or network cable documentation to [The Cable Bible](https://github.com/amiaopensource/cable-bible)

#### DOCUMENTATION: Add preservation info to media format wikipedia pages
--Charles Hosale | Add preservation information (or links to preservation information) to wikipedia pages of common media

#### DOCUMENTATION: OAIS comments
--Kara Van Malssen | The OAIS review period is in full swing right now. I'd like to pick up on this topic where it was left off [last year,](http://web.archive.org/web/20240520120158/http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2015#HACK_THE_DOCS:_OAIS_Edit-a-thon) taking a look at the comments that have been submitted to date, and identifying some specific feedback on the standard from the AV community.

#### Matroska [TBD]
--Idea by Dave Rice | Matroska specification work

#### Web Archiving + Metadata
--Idea by Lorena Ramirez Lopez | DIY web archiving that embeds more metadata (OSS option in lieu of Archive-It)

The manifesto of a recent event at the Open Repositories conference framed the benefits this way: “Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams...The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones. Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development...Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier.”

#### Our Manifesto
Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you are working on during your day job)

#### Pingüinos Anónimos - aka AV and Digital Preservation Resources in Spanish - Recursos sobre Preservación Audiovisual y Digital en Español

Participants:
* Pamela Vizner, AVP
* Jo Ana Morfin, Biblioteca Nacional de Mexico
* Jeannette Garcés, Biblioteca Nacional de Chile
* Juana Suárez, NYU
* Many remote volunteers (thank you!)

Description: This project is a follow up of the translation of the AMIA website to Spanish, orchestrated by the International Outreach Committee. We translated about 80% of the website, however, we left out the Resources page - we didn't want to provide a translated site with links to resources in English... pointless. So, we figured Hack Day would be a great way of taking advantage of our presence in one geographic location, and also leverage our networks to build this list in community. We have created a [google doc,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbUExq5d47ESp6yBWG2mvqMqqgh014AJ5AJ_LKpK7Us/edit) where people have been adding resources for the past three days.

Additionally, we have developed a survey to find which areas people think we have the biggest gaps in terms of documentation in Spanish. This survey, could inform future opportunities for translation and/or help guide the production of new documentation in this language. This survey is also tied to the [arturita](http://web.archive.org/web/20240711115507/https://arturita.net/) project, a digital humanities project that aims to centralize resources, provide access to reliable information for the safeguarding of audiovisual patrimony, and foster sustainable archival communities. Through this survey, we will gather information about the types of contents community wants arturita to publish.

Future tasks:
* Need to clean up the list
* Wishlist: some sort of tagging system.
* Send survey and publish results

We welcome folks from all experience and expertise backgrounds!

REMOTE PARTICIPATION will be available this year! Check in using the Slack channel and stay tuned to sign up for a project. You can then work offline/independently with your group in whatever way is easiest (video chat, chat, etc).

If you are unsure whether you can or want to participate in the hack day itself, you can still see the results by attending the AMIA closing plenary, where hack day projects will be presented, and the audience will have an opportunity to vote on their favorites.

### What will be the format of the event?
In advance of the hack day, project ideas and edit-a-thon topics will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. In advance of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, and Wikipedia editors, selecting an idea or topic(s) to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.

The day itself will be structured something like this. Coffee/tea will be provided. Lunch is on your own.

9am – Welcome, introductions

9:30 - noon - Hacking & doc editing. Coffee and snacks.

Noon-1pm – Lunch on your own.

1 - 4:30 - Hacking & doc editing. Coffee and snacks.

4:30 - 5 - Wrap up.

### Judging & presenting projects
At least one representative from each project group needs to be present for the demonstration of Hack Day projects to jurors on TIME & DATE TK. Judging typically lasts for approximately 1.5 -2 hours. Snacks and drinks are encouraged.

Projects will be presented to attendees in a session on TIME & DATE TK, where the jury will announce winners and attendees will vote on their favorite project.

### Summary
In association with the annual conference, the Association of Moving Image Archivists will host its 4th annual hack day on November 28th in Portland, OR. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical.

AMIA is once again thrilled to partner with the Digital Library Federation in organizing the hack day.

### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

You have the option to focus on documentation and knowledge sharing. Past projects include Wikipedia Edit-a-thons, creating or updating tool documentation, or reviewing and improving policy, standards, or procedural documentation. So if you're not a developer, or don't feel compelled to lend your digital preservation ideas to software and code development, you can contribute to creating new or updated content for the benefit of our community! You can read all about Wikipedia edit-a-thon events [here.](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon)

### Background
#### What is a hack day?
A hack day or hackathon is an event that brings together computer technologists and practitioners for an intense period of problem solving through computer programming. Within digital preservation and curation communities, hack days provide an opportunity for archivists, collection managers, and others to work together with technologists to develop software solutions for digital collections management needs. Hack days have been held independently by groups such as the Open Planets Foundation, as well as in association with preservation and access oriented conferences including Open Repositories and Museums and the Web.

The manifesto of a recent event at the Open Repositories conference framed the benefits this way: “Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams...The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones.

#### TC-04 to GitBook
--TC-04 to GitBook by *Erwin Verbruggen* | Looking to find a more modern publishing platform for the IASA TC-series, I would like to see how far we come with transposing the existing TC-04 PDF to GitBooks or alternative versioning & collaborative publishing platforms to see whether they're a good fit.

#### MediaInfo Dictionary
--MediaInfo Dictionary by *Erwin Verbruggen* | When I use MediaInfo there's a few fields I don't fully understand. LOC has started a [significant properties worksheet](http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/sigpropvideo.html) and I wonder whether it'd be useful to have a full overview of what all the different (non-significant?) fields mean

#### OSS AVArchiving Curriculum
--AVArchiving Curriculum by *Erwin Verbruggen* | I'm dreaming of an open source AV Archives curriculum, a step-by-step syllabys of openly available trainings that click together and make you an even more baller AV Archivist. Inspiration from the [Open Source Society University.](http://web.archive.org/web/20240515084917/https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) Can we do be heroes and do this in just one day?

### Past Hack Days
Hack Day 2022

Hack Day 2022 took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 6th, 2022 at the Omni William Penn Hotel during AMIA 2022. Hack Day 2022 was organized by Annie Schweikert, Tim Lake, and Kelley Coyne. Projects included:
* Video-game-formats, a collection of video game metadata resources and an initiative to expand existing controlled vocabularies for existing controlled vocabularies. Team members: Kayla Henry-Griffin, Stephany Kim, Henry Borchers, Rebecca Fraimow, Reto Kromer
* Avspace upgrade/spa day, an attempt to update a previous hack day plugin to make it compatible with today's version of ArchivesSpace. Henry Borchers spent a lot of time working on getting ASpace up and running, teaching himself Ruby, and trying to get the plugin working again, and even though it did not result in a finished project, it's a familiar experience to anyone who has bashed their head against a problem, and his progress can help inform people in the future who might pick up this work.
