### How do I sign up/participate?
[Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSegPlwLDaEAaeVztD0G7d_o6DHbgX9dT8sZccD-94sUNlYt3Q/viewform?usp=sf_link). As this will be a highly participatory event, registration is limited to those willing to get their hands dirty, so no onlookers please. We welcome folks from all experience and expertise backgrounds!

REMOTE PARTICIPATION will be available this year! Check in using the Slack channel and stay tuned to sign up for a project. You can then work offline/independently with your group in whatever way is easiest (video chat, chat, etc).

If you are unsure whether you can or want to participate in the hack day itself, you can still see the results by attending the AMIA closing plenary, where hack day projects will be presented, and the audience will have an opportunity to vote on their favorites.

### What will be the format of the event?
In advance of the hack day, project ideas and edit-a-thon topics will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. In advance of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, and Wikipedia editors, selecting an idea or topic(s) to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.

The day itself will be structured something like this. Coffee/tea will be provided. Lunch is on your own.

9am – Welcome, introductions

9:30 - noon - Hacking & doc editing. Coffee and snacks.

Noon-1pm – Lunch on your own.

1 - 4:30 - Hacking & doc editing. Coffee and snacks.

4:30 - 5 - Wrap up.

### Judging & presenting projects
At least one representative from each project group needs to be present for the demonstration of Hack Day projects to jurors on TIME & DATE TK. Judging typically lasts for approximately 1.5 -2 hours. Snacks and drinks are encouraged.

Projects will be presented to attendees in a session on TIME & DATE TK, where the jury will announce winners and attendees will vote on their favorite project.

### Summary
In association with the annual conference, the Association of Moving Image Archivists will host its 4th annual hack day on November 28th in Portland, OR. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical.

AMIA is once again thrilled to partner with the Digital Library Federation in organizing the hack day.

### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

You have the option to focus on documentation and knowledge sharing. Past projects include Wikipedia Edit-a-thons, creating or updating tool documentation, or reviewing and improving policy, standards, or procedural documentation. So if you're not a developer, or don't feel compelled to lend your digital preservation ideas to software and code development, you can contribute to creating new or updated content for the benefit of our community! You can read all about Wikipedia edit-a-thon events [here.](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon)

### Background
#### What is a Hack Day?
A hack day or hackathon is an event that brings together computer technologists and practitioners for an intense period of problem solving through computer programming. Within digital preservation and curation communities, hack days provide an opportunity for archivists, collection managers, and others to work together with technologists to develop software solutions for digital collections management needs. Hack days have been held independently by groups such as the Open Planets Foundation, as well as in association with preservation and access oriented conferences including Open Repositories and Museums and the Web.

The manifesto of a recent event at the Open Repositories conference framed the benefits this way: “Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams...The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones. Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development...Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier.”

#### Our Manifesto
Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you are working on during your day job)

#### Pingüinos Anónimos - aka AV and Digital Preservation Resources in Spanish - Recursos sobre Preservación Audiovisual y Digital en Español

Participants:
* Pamela Vizner, AVP
* Jo Ana Morfin, Biblioteca Nacional de Mexico
* Jeannette Garcés, Biblioteca Nacional de Chile
* Juana Suárez, NYU
* Many remote volunteers (thank you!)

Description: This project is a follow up of the translation of the AMIA website to Spanish, orchestrated by the International Outreach Committee. We translated about 80% of the website, however, we left out the Resources page - we didn't want to provide a translated site with links to resources in English... pointless. So, we figured Hack Day would be a great way of taking advantage of our presence in one geographic location, and also leverage our networks to build this list in community. We have created a [google doc,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pbUExq5d47ESp6yBWG2mvqMqqgh014AJ5AJ_LKpK7Us/edit) where people have been adding resources for the past three days.

Additionally, we have developed a survey to find which areas people think we have the biggest gaps in terms of documentation in Spanish. This survey, could inform future opportunities for translation and/or help guide the production of new documentation in this language. This survey is also tied to the [arturita](http://web.archive.org/web/20240711115507/https://arturita.net/) project, a digital humanities project that aims to centralize resources, provide access to reliable information for the safeguarding of audiovisual patrimony, and foster sustainable archival communities. Through this survey, we will gather information about the types of contents community wants arturita to publish.

Future tasks:
* Need to clean up the list
* Wishlist: some sort of tagging system.
* Send survey and publish results
