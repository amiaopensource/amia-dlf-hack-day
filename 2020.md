*[originally hosted at [Association of Moving Image Archivists & Digital Library Federation Hack Day](https://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day), which was repurposed to advertise the cancelled 2020 Hack Day]*

Since 2013, DLF has co-sponsored an annual Hack Day at AMIA conferences, sometimes sending DLF practitioners as funded fellows to participate and sometimes fostering "cross-pollinator" collaborations with our DLF Forum and the National Digital Stewardship Alliance's Digital Preservation conference.

AMIA-DLF Hack Days are unique opportunities for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with digital library developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for audiovisual preservation and access.

## Association of Moving Image Archivists & Digital Library Federation Hack Day
Hack Day is a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. Hack day is a partnership between the Association for Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) and the Digital Library Federation (DLF). A robust and diverse community of practitioners who advance research, teaching and learning through the application of digital library research, technology and services, DLF brings years of experience creating and hosting events designed to foster collaboration and develop shared solutions for common challenges. It will be fun and practical…and there will be prizes!

Manifesto:
* Transparent, fun, open collaboration in diversely constituted teams over individual brilliance and/or groups of like individuals in cut-throat competition.
* The creation of new professional networks over the ossification of old ones
* Effective engagement of non-developers (researchers, repository managers) in development over purely developer driven projects.
* Work done at the conference over presentation of something prepared earlier (meaning not working on a project you are working on during your day job)

The goal of this wiki resource is to:
* consolidate all resources produced by and concerning AMIA/DLF Hack Day;
* document all past hack days and their respective projects;
* provide a template for the organization of future hack days.

#### Summary
In association with the annual conference, the Association of Moving Image Archivists will host a Hack Day during the conference. The event will be a unique opportunity for practitioners and managers of digital audiovisual collections to join with developers and engineers for an intense day of collaboration to develop solutions for digital audiovisual preservation and access. It will be fun and practical.

AMIA is once again thrilled to partner with the [Digital Library Federation](http://www.clir.org/dlf/) in organizing the hack day.

#### What if I’m not a developer?
Content managers and preservation practitioners are as central to the success of the event as having keen developers. YOU will be responsible for setting the agenda and the outcomes. The goal is to foster collaboration between audiovisual preservation specialists and technologists, to solve problems together and share expertise.

You have the option to focus on documentation and knowledge sharing. Past projects include Wikipedia Edit-a-thons, creating or updating tool documentation, or reviewing and improving policy, standards, or procedural documentation. So if you're not a developer, or don't feel compelled to lend your digital preservation ideas to software and code development, you can contribute to creating new or updated content for the benefit of our community! You can read all about Wikipedia edit-a-thon events [here](http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Edit-a-thon).

#### What will be the format of the event?
In advance of the hack day, project ideas and edit-a-thon topics will be collected through the registration form and the event wiki. In advance of the event, participants will review and discuss submitted project ideas. We’ll then break into groups consisting of technologists and practitioners, and Wikipedia editors, selecting an idea or topic(s) to work on together for the day and (if desired) throughout the duration of the AMIA conference in the developers lounge.

#### Judging & presenting projects
At least one representative from each project group needs to be present for the demonstration of Hack Day projects to jurors. Judging typically lasts for approximately 1.5 -2 hours. Snacks and drinks are encouraged.

Projects will be presented to attendees in a session, where the jury will announce winners and attendees will vote on their favorite project.
